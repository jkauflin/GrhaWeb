# hoadb
A LAMP based UI for a homeowners association database using HTML5, JQuery, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL.  Includes logic for making online payments through Paypal, as well as creating and sending PDF dues statements by email.  I have been using this successfully for several years for running my HOA but probably not a 100% complete or beginners solution.  If you are trying to do something like this, this project will provide some good example code, and database model, but you should be comfortable and familiar with development in all of these areas, and pick and choose what you want to incorporate into your own project.
